If that was the case, then the red car definitely deserved most of the fault. The man may have walked out in front of the car without giving it time to react, however. Also, I don't know if the other car may have made the red car veer and lose control. But going with what I saw, the car that was further back at the beginning is mostly at fault for the whole situation.", "comprehension": "E", "doneBefore": "Yes", "sex": "Male", "age": "40", "comments": "No difficulties.
