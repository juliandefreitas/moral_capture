The man is clearly far enough in front of the car that if the car had been stopped it would've absorbed the impact of the red car and not been able to lurch forward at such a rate to hit the man.", "comprehension": "E", "doneBefore": "No", "sex": "Female", "age": "46", "comments": "No technical trouble.
