The red car then seemingly merged with the blue car and remained merged for one frame. Since it's not possible for cars to merge into one, I assume that the cars are not exactly in the same plane. As in, the red car is more to the side of the blue car, so that if you were seeing it from overhead, they would be parallel like this ||. The blue car, for some reason, then accelerated ahead and hit the man. Therefore the blue car is to blame.", "comprehension": "E", "doneBefore": "No", "sex": "Male", "age": "27", "comments": "None.", "displayTime": 0}]}
