218,0,1,234,"The video showed the red car approaching the blue car from behind. The red car then seemingly merged with the blue car and remained merged for one frame. Since it's not possible for cars to merge into one, I assume that the cars are not exactly in the same plane. As in, the red car is more to the side of the blue car, so that if you were seeing it from overhead, they would be parallel like this ||. The blue car, for some reason, then accelerated ahead and hit the man. Therefore the blue car is to blame."
219,0,1,235,"It looked as if the red car did not hit the blue car into the person nor hit the person. It does look as if the blue car hit the person, therefore the blue car would be to blame."

225,0,1,241,because he was passing the red car and hit the man
226,0,0,242,"Basically because had the driver of the blue car been using their brakes, they likely would've have hit the man in the first place."

234,0,0,250,The blue car should not have stopped as quickly
235,0,1,252,"The blue car directly hit the person. There is a very small chance based on the animation that the red car bumped into the blue car, causing it to hit the man. Very unlikely in this case. The blame goes to the blue car for hitting the man."

242,0,0,259,"Although the blue car should not have all that piled on top of it, the pile did not fall or hit the man. In fact the pile probably delayed the accident because it probably required more force for the red car to force the blue car into the man. We do not know if the blue car saw the red car coming so that it might have swerved or put on the brakes to avoid hitting the man."
